# Visualise OMOP

There are over 7 million concepts in OMOP, and over 45 million relationships between concepts. Looking at numbers is hard. Looking at charts (should be) easier. This project visualises the concepts and relationships in OMOP.

## Usage

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework) app. To start the local preview server, run:

```
